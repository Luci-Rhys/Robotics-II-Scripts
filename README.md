# Robotics-II-Scripts

This repo contains scripts needed to autonomously navigate a Turtlebot3 robot. These scripts are used in CSCI 4561 Robotics II at Austin Peay State University for a semester project in which the robot autonomously navigates a makeshit maze and completes tasks. Depending on the opportunities available, it may be later expanded to include other robots or other tasks
